# Data Validation in Microsoft Excel



### *What is Data Validation?*

Data Validation is a tool within Excel that allows the user to predetermine what types of data can be entered into a cell. For example, the user could lock a set of cells to only allow whole numbers to be entered, or to only allow dates to be entered. 

### *Why is Data Validation useful?*

Using data validation can reduce errors when filling in spreadsheets by making sure the user only inputs the intended form of data. For example, 30 instead of thirty. It can also increase productivity by offering the user direct access to a few allowed inputs instead of making them remember and manually input them. 

### *How do you use it?*

Assuming you know how to create an excel spreadsheet, using data validation is simple. In my example, we will use an employee timesheet template.
